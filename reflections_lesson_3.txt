When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository makes it possible to work with people far away.  It also makes you less vulnerable to losing all your work.  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with the remote repository?
Just because some has updated files in the repository doesn’t mean they’re production ready.  Also if you’re in the middle of writing a certain feature, you may not want to be nuisanced with the minor changes of your co-contributors.
