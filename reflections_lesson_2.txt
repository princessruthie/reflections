Question What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing manual merges?  
A: Git's automatic merging is good in that is only does the safest merges.  Always doing it manually would be good for fine control.  Two team members might both add code that do the same thing.  Git wouldn't force a conflict resolution in such a case.  But that seems more like team management problem.
